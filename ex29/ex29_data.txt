Doc-Centric Sales: Midwest Region
The Midwest region had another strong sales year with record-setting sales of both the M300-25 and M100-11 models. The only disappointment was the lackluster sales of the M300-15 model, which started the year strong but tapered off into the fourth quarter. All-in-all though, a very good year for the Midwest region. 
============
Doc-Centric Sales: Northeast Region
The Northeast region had a mixed sales year last year. Some models like the C300-25 performed admirably, while others like the C200-20 had disappointing years. We anticipate a stronger year in current year with the introduction of the C300-30 model - a great copier at a competitive price. 
===========
Doc-Centric Sales: South Region
Sales in the Southern region were off last year as the economy entered a slight downturn. Sales of the M100-10 model suffered the largest decline - 15% under sales two years ago. The lone bright spot was the continuing strong sales of the M300-25 unit which increased as last year progressed. 
=============
Doc-Centric Sales: West Region
Sales in the west were the most successful of the four regions. Some of Doc-Centric's success can be attributed to our long-standing base of customers. The sales of the M100-11 model were particularly encouraging. We anticipate even greater success in the current year.
